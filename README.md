# Student Feedback and Analysis Management - Frontend (React)

This is the React-based frontend for the **Student Feedback and Analysis Management** application. It interacts with the backend API (built with Spring Boot) to manage student feedback, analyze it, and generate reports.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following installed:
- **Node.js** (v14 or later)
- **npm** (Package manager)

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/udaykallam/StudentFeedbackAndAnalysisManagement.git
cd student-feedback-frontend
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Once you've cloned the project, navigate to the project folder and install the required dependencies using **npm** or **yarn**.

With **npm**:

```bash
npm install
```

To run the React application locally, use the following command:

With **npm**:

```bash
npm run dev
```


This should start the React development server at `http://localhost:5173`, and you should be able to interact with the frontend.
